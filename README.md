# 🌊 PJDSC Flood Prediction System

**Project for PJDSC Hackathon 2025**
A web-based flood prediction system integrating AI, geospatial data, and weather analysis.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **PJDSC Flood Prediction System** is designed to predict potential flooded areas based on user-provided **latitude**, **longitude**, and **radius**.
It uses a trained AI model deployed as a microservice, with clean API communication between backend and frontend layers.

### 🧩 Architecture

This project follows a **hybrid MVC + microservice architecture**:

* **Frontend:**
  Built with **React.js**, deployed on **Vercel**.
  → Temporary live link: [https://pjdsc-weather-data-frontend.vercel.app](https://pjdsc-weather-data-frontend.vercel.app)

* **Backend (API Gateway):**
  A **Django** application hosted on **Render**, acting as a secure middle layer between the frontend and the AI microservice.

* **AI Microservice:**
  A separate Python service hosted on **Render** for flood prediction using weather and location inputs.
  → Processes sanitized data sent from the backend and returns prediction results.

* **Storage:**
  **Supabase Storage** is used to store large model artifacts (e.g., `.pkl` files) and datasets.

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Below is the `.env` structure (no need to share your actual secrets — this is just for reference):

```env
SUPABASE_DATABASE_PASSWORD=
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_KEY=
MICROSERVICE_URL=
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=
DJANGO_DEBUG=
```

⚠️ **Security Note:**
Do **not** commit your `.env` file to Git. Use Render’s or Vercel’s **Environment Variable settings** panel to manage these securely.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The **frontend** sends an API request to the **backend** with parameters:

   ```json
   {
     "latitude": 14.5995,
     "longitude": 120.9842,
     "radius": 10000
   }
   ```

2. The **backend** sanitizes the request and forwards it to the **AI microservice**.

3. The **AI microservice** processes the data using the pre-trained model and returns predictions.

4. The **backend** sanitizes the response and sends it back to the **frontend** for display.
